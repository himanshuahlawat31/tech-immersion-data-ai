## Technology overview

Azure Machine Learning uses a Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) approach, which improves the quality and consistency of your machine learning solutions. Azure Machine Learning Service provides the following MLOps capabilities:

- Integration with Azure Pipelines. Define continuous integration and deployment workflows for your models.
- A model registry that maintains multiple versions of your trained models.
- Model validation. Automatically validate your trained models and select the optimal configuration for deploying them into production.
- Deploy your models as a web service in the cloud, locally, or to IoT Edge devices.
- Monitor your deployed model's performance, so you can drive improvements in the next version of the model.

## Scenario overview

In this experience you will learn how Contoso Auto can use MLOps to formalize the process of training and deploying new models using a DevOps approach.

## Exercise 1: Setup New Project in Azure DevOps

Duration: 20 minutes

### Task 1: Create New Project

1. Sign in to [Azure DevOps](http://dev.azure.com).

2. Select **New project**.

    ![Provide information as shown in the dialog.](media/sc_02.png 'Add an Azure Resource Manager service connection dialog')

## Exercise 2: Setup and Run the Build Pipeline

Duration: 25 minutes

> **Note**: This exercise requires the new version of the **Pipelines** user interface. To activate it, select **Pipelines** from the left navigation. If the first option below **Pipelines** is **Builds**, you are still running on the previous version of the user interface. In this case, a popup should appear suggesting the activation of the new user interface.
>
> ![Activate the new Azure Pipelines user interface.](media/devops-ui-activation.png 'Multi-stage pipelines activation')
>
> Select **Try it!** to activate the new Pipelines user interface. When successfully activated, the first option below **Pipelines** from the left navigation will change to **Pipelines**.

### Task 1: Setup Build Pipeline

1. From left navigation select **Pipelines, Pipelines** and then select **Create pipeline**.

    ![Navigate to Pipelines, Pipelines, and then select Create pipeline](media/devops-build-pipeline-07.png 'Create Build Pipeline')

2. Select **Azure Repos Git** as your code repository.

    ![Select your code repository source for your new build pipeline.](media/devops-build-pipeline-08.png 'Repository Source')

3. Select **mlops-quickstart** as your repository.

    ![Select mlops-quickstart as your repository.](media/devops-build-pipeline-09.png 'Select Repository')

4. Review the YAML file.

    The build pipeline has four key steps:

    a. Attach folder to workspace and experiment. This command creates the `.azureml` subdirectory that contains a `config.json` file that is used to communicate with your Azure Machine Learning workspace. All subsequent steps rely on the `config.json` file to instantiate the workspace object.

    b. Create the AML Compute target to run your master pipeline for model training and model evaluation.

    c. Run the master pipeline. The master pipeline has two steps: (1) Train the machine learning model, and (2) Evaluate the trained machine learning model. The evaluation step evaluates if the new model performance is better than the currently deployed model. If the new model performance is improved, the evaluate step will create a new Image for deployment. The results of the evaluation step will be saved in a file called `eval_info.json` that will be made available for the release pipeline. You can review the code for the master pipeline and its steps in `aml_service/pipelines_master.py`,  `scripts/train.py`, and `scripts/evaluate.py`.

    d. Publish the build artifacts. The `snapshot of the repository`, `config.json`, and `eval_info.json` files are published as build artifacts and thus can be made available for the release pipeline.

    ![Review the build pipeline YAML file.](media/devops-build-pipeline-10.png 'Build pipeline YAML')

### Task 2: Run the Build Pipeline

1. Select **Run** to start running your build pipeline.

    ![Start the run for your build pipeline.](media/devops-build-pipeline-11.png 'Run Build Pipeline')

2. Monitor the build run. The build pipeline, for the first run, will take around 20 minutes to run.

    ![Monitor your build pipeline. It will take around 20 minutes to run.](media/devops-build-pipeline-12.png 'Monitor Build Pipeline')

3. Select **Job** to monitor the detailed status of the build pipeline execution.

    ![Monitor the details of your build pipeline.](media/devops-build-pipeline-13.png 'Monitor Build Pipeline Details')

### Task 3: Review Build Artifacts

1. The build will publish an artifact named `devops-for-ai`. Select **Artifacts, 1 published** to review the artifact contents.

    ![Select Artifacts, 1 published to review the artifact contents.](media/devops-build-pipeline-14.png 'Build Artifacts')

2. Select **outputs, eval_info.json** and then select the download arrow. The `eval_info.json` is the output from the *model evaluation* step and the information from the evaluation step will be later used in the release pipeline to deploy the model. Select the back arrow to return to the previous screen.

    ![Download output from the model evaluation step.](media/devops-build-pipeline-15.png 'Download JSON file')

3. Open the `eval_info.json` in a json viewer or a text editor and observe the information. The json output contains information such as if the model passed the evaluation step (`deploy_model`: *true or false*) and evaluation accuracy.

    ![Review information in the eval_info json file.](media/devops-build-pipeline-16.png 'Eval Info JSON File')

### Task 4: Review Build Outputs

1. Log in to [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml.azure.com) either directly or via the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com). Make sure you select the Azure Machine Learning workspace that you created from the notebook earlier. Open your **Models** section, and observe the versions of the registered model: `compliance-classifier`. The latest version is the one registered by the build pipeline you have run in the previous task.

    ![Review registered model in Azure Machine Learning studio.](media/ai-20.png 'Registered Models in Azure Machine Learning studio')

2. Select the latest version of your model to review its properties. Notice the ```build_number``` tag which links the registered to model to the Azure DevOps build that generated it.

    ![Review registered model properties, notice Build_Number tag.](!media/../media/ai-21.png 'Registered model details and Build_Number tag')

3. Open your **Datasets** section and observe the versions of the registered dataset: ```connected_car_components```. The latest version is the one registered by the build pipeline you have run in the previous task.

    ![Review registered dataset in Azure Machine Learning studio.](media/ai-22.png 'Registered Datasets in Azure Machine Learning studio')

4. Select the latest version of your dataset to review its properties. Notice the ```build_number``` tag that links the dataset version to the Azure DevOps build that generated it.

    ![Review registered dataset version properties, notice Build_Number tag.](medial/../media/devops-build-outputs-04.png 'Registered dataset details in Azure Machine Learning studio')

5. Select **Models** to view a list of registered models that reference the dataset.

    ![Review list of registered models that reference dataset in Azure Machine Learning studio.](media/devops-build-outputs-05.png 'Registered dataset model references in Azure Machine Learning studio')
